# The Goal
Get this [camera](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07R8LQKV4/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) to do metric, stereo depth, on YOLOv8 output.

# The Plan
In order not to make the one camera zone's too big (these are problematic as you cannot do stereo depth in them), the right side of the right camera feed will be cropped, and the same with the left.
