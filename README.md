# Run
```
git clone https://github.com/JoshuaChick/YOLOv8-stereo-depth

```
cd YOLOv8-stereo-depth

pip3 install -r requirements.txt

```
python script.py
```
Notes: 
- I used this [camera](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07R8LQKV4/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) when making this project. If you don't have this camera you can easily [edit the software yourself](#editing-the-software) to suit your camera.
- If you have multiple cameras please ensure the correct camera is being used by the program. If you think the wrong one is being selected go to the line with ```cam = cv2.VideoCapture(0)``` in ```script.py``` and increment the number until the correct camera is selected.

```script.py``` will give you a live video with labels and depths (video below is live and is ~25fps on RTX4060 ti 16GB).

# Overview
Got this [camera](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07R8LQKV4/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) to do metric, stereo depth, on YOLOv8 output.

# How It Works
The images from both cameras are gathered.

Right image run through yolo.

Left image through yolo. Now left and right have been run through yolo.

Work out angles from base of cameras to centres of those objects. And using the distance between the cameras you can trianglulate

## Technicalities
- To account for multiple of same object, pairs of the same object are decided based on similarity of y-coord of top left corner of bounding box. (Going left to right will not work, you can look into this if you want (imagine something close and something far, etc...)).
- Depths of objects are measured from right camera.

# Editing the software
In ```script.py```:

Set the resolution of your stereoscopic camera.

![alt text](https://github.com/JoshuaChick/Yolov8StereoDepth/blob/main/ReadMeImages/setResolution.png?raw=true)

Update INDIVIDUAL_CAMERA_FOV_X, INDIVIDUAL_CAMERA_FOV_Y, and DISTANCE_BETWEEN_CAMERAS. You may need to experiment with these if results are not satisfactory, as things like fish eye lenses may cause problems.

If you are using two separate cameras ensure that the l and r variables are being set to the left and right image respectively. Then set the stereoscopic camera resolution (as if they were combined side by side), then set the fov's and distance between cameras.
